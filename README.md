## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was learning all about relative units with this project. I tried to use rem, em, %, and other relative units rather than absolute units like pixels. I've been reading Manning Publication's CSS IN DEPTH by Keith J. Grant.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my ability to build fluid, responsive layouts and keep improving with my layout/positioning skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth) - This helped understand relative units and the box model really well. Chapters 1-4.
